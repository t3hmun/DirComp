# DirComp

Program created to compare folders.

Overcomplicated, but it's intended to be extended in the future when I need it to be.

Reads directory/folder structure into memory in one go before doing anythgin with them.

## Current functionality

 * Lists folders and files that folder B has that folder A does not. 
  * Does not list files inside folders that that A doesn't have - that is implied.
  * Only checks folder/file names, ignores size, date etc.
